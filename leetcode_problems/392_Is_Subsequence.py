"""
 Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Naive algorithm:
1. Store seen character
2. Check duplicate
3. Return true if all seen else false

Corner case:
1. len(s) > len(t)
2. s and/or t is empty
3. order of character between s and t are different: 
s = "agh"
t = "ahbgdc"
using only lookup for character fails for this test case. Always check the head for the lookup
4. empty("") subsequence is always a subsequence of given string

"""
            The find() method returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in given string. If its is not found then it returns -1.
            Syntax :

            str.find(sub,start,end)
            Parameters :

            sub : Itâ€™s the substring which needs to be searched in the given string.
            start : Starting position where sub is needs to be checked within the string.
            end : Ending position where suffix is needs to be checked within the string. 

            NOTE : If start and end indexes are not provided then by default it takes 0 and length-1 as starting and ending indexes where ending indxes is not included in our search.
